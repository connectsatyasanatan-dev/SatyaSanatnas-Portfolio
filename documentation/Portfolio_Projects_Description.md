Zentara is an intelligent AI assistant embedded directly into the portfolio, built to represent the developer and help visitors learn about skills, projects, and availability.

Features include streaming text responses, voice input (Web Speech API), conversation history, smart fallback responses when AI is unavailable, sentiment detection, time-based greetings, copy-to-clipboard, retry on failure, and quick-chip shortcuts. The UI is a custom-built floating chat window with smooth animations, a branded Zentara avatar, and a tooltip popup system.
